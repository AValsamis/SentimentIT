<b>SentimentIT</b> is a tool that lets its users identify and mark the sentiment of certain tweets with respect to some topic. The purpose of that is to construct the ground truth of a tweet dataset, in order to eventually be able to evaluate automated approaches in opinion mining.
In addition, gamification elements such as user and group leaderboard exist, that motivate users to collect points for themselves or for the organization that they represent.

Constructed for and under support from [CONSENSUS](http://consensus-project.eu/) a project co-funded by the EC under the FP7 Programme.
